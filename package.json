The main purpose of this fork was to fix its very incorrect implementation of Colemak-DH.\r It was starting to become quite a problem for the [Colemak Community](https://discordapp.com/invite/3UkgpGC), as many were investing significant time into learning the wrong layout!\r However, this fork is now a platform for the community to add additional improvements.",
